# ðŸ§  The Impact of AI on Software Development and Engineering

This project is a research-based survey aimed at understanding how the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is affecting the field of software development and engineering.

## ðŸ“‹ Whatâ€™s Inside?
The core of this project is a Google Form that collects insights from developers, students, and IT professionals on:

- How AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and others are being used in development
- Perceptions about job security in the AI era
- The evolving role of problem-solving and critical thinking in tech
- What skills will be essential for future developers
